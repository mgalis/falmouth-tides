# Tides times for Falmouth beaches

High tide times are different in various parts of Falmouth, MA, and the primary reason is local geography and bathymetry (the shape of the seafloor).

The tide is not a uniform wall of water that arrives everywhere at once. It's a massive wave that moves across the ocean, and its timing is heavily influenced by how it interacts with landmasses and underwater features.

Here's why you see these differences in Falmouth:

Friction and Bottlenecks: As the tidal wave moves into Vineyard Sound, it's a relatively open body of water. However, to reach locations like Falmouth Harbor, Woods Hole, or Waquoit Bay, the water must flow through narrow inlets and channels. This process is slowed by friction with the seabed and the resistance of the narrow passages, causing a delay.

Sequential Filling: The outer coast facing Vineyard Sound experiences high tide first. The water then needs to flow inward, gradually raising the water level in the more enclosed harbors and bays. This creates a time lag between the peak high tide on the open coast and the peak high tide inside the harbor.

For instance, the high tide in Falmouth Harbor can occur as much as 30 to 45 minutes later than the high tide on the open coast in Vineyard Sound. This is because the harbor acts like a bottleneck that takes a certain amount of time to fill up from the water flowing in from the main body of the Sound.
